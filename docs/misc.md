## Podman

Docker charges for certain services, and so a movement to create open source
equivalents have mobilized. One replacement, for developers to use, is
to use [Podman Desktop][] instead of [Docker Desktop][].

```shell
brew install podman-desktop
```

[podman desktop]: https://podman-desktop.io/
[docker desktop]: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
